## Important Notes

<Note>
All generation tasks on KIE are **asynchronous**. A successful `200` response only means the task was created, not completed.

To get final results, you must either:
1. Provide a `callBackUrl` (webhook) in your request
2. Poll the record info API using the `task_id`
</Note>

<Warning>
Never expose your API key in frontend code, mobile apps, or public repositories. Treat your API key as a secret.
</Warning>
