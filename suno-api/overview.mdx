## Async Workflow

All Suno tasks are asynchronous with multiple callback stages:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `text` | Lyrics/text generation complete |
| `first` | First track complete |
| `complete` | All tracks complete |

```python
# With webhook - recommended
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/generate",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer API_KEY"},
    json={
        "prompt": "A jazz song",
        "callBackUrl": "https://your-server.com/webhook"
    }
)

# Without webhook - poll for results
task_id = response.json()["data"]["taskId"]
# Poll /record-info endpoint
```

## Pricing

Music generation is priced per task. Longer durations and newer models cost more. See [pricing](https://kie.ai/pricing) for details.
