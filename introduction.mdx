## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#1-available-models-&-playground)1. Available Models & Playground

[https://kie.ai/market](https://kie.ai/market)

- We continuously update and onboard new models as soon as they are stable.
- Each model page links to its Playground, where you can test and experiment directly in our UI before calling the API.
- The Playground is the best place to understand model behavior, parameters, and output formats.

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#2-pricing)2. Pricing

[https://kie.ai/pricing](https://kie.ai/pricing)

- Our prices are typically 30%–50% lower than official APIs.
- For some models, discounts can reach up to 80%.
- Pricing may change as upstream providers adjust their costs, so always refer to the pricing page for the latest numbers.

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#3-creating-and-securing-your-api-key)3. Creating and Securing Your API Key

[https://kie.ai/api-key](https://kie.ai/api-key)

- Never expose your API key in frontend code (browser, mobile apps, public repositories).
- Treat your API key as a secret.
- Rate limits per key (hourly, daily, and total usage caps)
- IP whitelist support, allowing only approved server IPs to access the API

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#4-required-request-headers)4. Required Request Headers

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json
```

If the key is invalid or missing:

```json
{ "code": 401, "msg": "You do not have access permissions" }
```

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#5-logs-&-task-details)5. Logs & Task Details

[https://kie.ai/logs](https://kie.ai/logs)

- Creation time
- Model used
- Input parameters
- Task status
- Credit consumption
- Final results or error details

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#6-data-retention-policy)6. Data Retention Policy

- Generated media files: stored for 14 days, then automatically deleted
- Log records (text / metadata): stored for 2 months, then automatically deleted

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#7-asynchronous-task-model)7. Asynchronous Task Model

Most generation APIs are asynchronous.

- The immediate response is usually HTTP 200 with a `task_id`.
- You can either:
  - Provide a callback (webhook) URL in the request, or
  - Actively poll the “query record info” API using the `task_id`.

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#8-rate-limits-&-concurrency)8. Rate Limits & Concurrency

- Up to 20 new generation requests per 10 seconds
- This typically allows 100+ concurrent running tasks
- Limits are applied per account
- Requests will be rejected with HTTP 429
- Rejected requests will not enter the queue

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#9-developer-support)9. Developer Support

- Get help on Discord
- Get help on Telegram
- Private, 1-on-1 channels
- Your data and conversations remain confidential
- Faster and more technical responses
- Email: support@kie.ai

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#10-stability-expectations)10. Stability Expectations

- We are not perfect
- Our overall stability may be slightly lower than official providers
- This is a conscious trade-off to provide lower prices and unified access

## [​](https://docs.kie.ai/#11-about-the-team)11. About the Team

- We move fast
- We care deeply about developer experience
- We are constantly improving
- Not everything is perfect
- We can’t satisfy every use case immediately
